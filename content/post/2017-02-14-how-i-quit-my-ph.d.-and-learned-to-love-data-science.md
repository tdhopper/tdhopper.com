description: Slides from a talk I gave on data science as a career.

I recently gave to the [Duke Big Data Initiative](http://bigdata.duke.edu/) entitled _<s>Dr.</s> Hopper, or How I Quit My Ph.D. and Learned to Love Data Science_. The talk was well received, and [my slides](https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/827239362404433922/photo/1) seemed to resonate in the Twitter data science community.

I've started a long-form blog post with the same message, but it's not done yet. In the mean time, I wanted to share the slides that want along with the talk.
