    "If your lucky (i.e. your systems and networks were setup sufficiently similar to mine), you can run this exact same command to configure and start a process on your own system.

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible is a powerful, customizable tool. Unlike some similar tools, it requires very little setup to start using it. As I've learned more about it, I've seen more and more ways in which I could've used it in copious projects in the past; I intend to make it a regular part of my toolkit. (Historically I've done this kind of thing with hacky combinations of shell scripts and [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/); Ansible would often be better.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial just scratches the surface of the Ansible functionality. If you want to learn more, I again recommend reading through the [docs](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/index.html); they're very good. Of course, you should start writing and running your own playbooks as soon as possible! I also liked [this tutorial from Server Admin for Programmers](https://serversforhackers.com/an-ansible-tutorial). If you want to compare Ansible to alternatives, the [Taste Test book](https://valdhaus.co/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-ansible.html) by Matt Jaynes looks promising. For more on Supervisor, [serversforhackers.com](https://serversforhackers.com/monitoring-processes-with-supervisord) has a nice tutorial, and [its docs are thorough](http://supervisord.org/).\n",
