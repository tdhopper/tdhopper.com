description: How to run an AWS Linux AMI in a Virtual Machine on MacOS.

I wanted to test some Python code on my Mac before deploying it to an AWS box, so I made this [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/ "Vagrant by HashiCorp") file to run [Conda](https://anaconda.org/) in an [Amazon Linux AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/ "AWS | Amazon Linux") virtual machine.
