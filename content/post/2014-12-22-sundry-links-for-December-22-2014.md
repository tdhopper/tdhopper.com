[Time](http://unix4lyfe.org/time/?v=1): Programmers all hate time, timezones, etc. Here are some helpful "notes about time".

[Python strftime reference](http://strftime.org/): Speaking of time: "A quick reference for Python's strftime formatting directives." I have to look this stuff each time I need it.

[gitup](https://github.com/earwig/git-repo-updater): "A console script that allows you to easily update multiple git repositories at once"

[The “How Does a Google Coder Work?” Edition
](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/working/2014/12/google_software_engineer_nina_kang_talks_about_the_differences_between_writing.html): I enjoyed this interview. My favorite quote? "When you're reading code is it as clear as reading English?" "If I'm reading C++ code, it's clearer."

[Sunset Salvo](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/HoldingPen/SunsetSalvo.pdf): John Turkey discusses practical data analysis and statistical humility.

[10th Conference on Bayesian Nonparametrics](https://stat.duke.edu/bnp10/index.html%3Fpage_id=1.html): This is coming up in my own back yard. I’m excited!

[Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43146.pdf): I haven’t read this in detail, but the premise makes tons of sense to me: "It is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning."
