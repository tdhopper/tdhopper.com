My friends [Andrew](http"//www.twitter.com/akm) and [Joel](http://www.twitter.com/joelgrus) were kind enough to have me back on their podcast [Adversarial Learning](http://adversariallearning.com/episode-10-stories-of-degradation-and-humiliation.html). We shared our tales of bad data science interviews. Enjoy!
