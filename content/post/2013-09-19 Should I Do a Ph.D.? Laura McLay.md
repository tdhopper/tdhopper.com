__Update 12-08-2014:__ I decided to make a dedicated website to host the interviews. You can find it at [shouldigetaphd.com](http://shouldigetaphd.com/).

Continuing [my series](http://stiglerdiet.com/category/should-i-do-a-phd.html), I talked to Laura McLay, a professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

_A 22-year old college student has been accepted to a Ph.D. program in a technical field. He's academically talented, and he's always enjoyed school and his subject matter. His acceptance is accompanied with 5-years of guaranteed funding. He doesn't have any job offers but suspects he could get a decent job as a software developer. He's not sure what to do. What advice would you give him, or what questions might you suggest he ask himself as he goes about making the decision?_

__Laura:__ I would recommend visiting [Tough love: An insensitive guide to thriving in your Ph.D.](http://neurochambers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/tough-love-insensitive-guide-to.html "NeuroChambers: Tough love: An insensitive guide to thriving in your Ph.D.") by Chris Chambers for guide for knowing if you are ready to pursue a Ph.D. I don't have too much to add. If this list doesn't frighten you much, then I highly recommend relocating to attend a top Ph.D. program in your field, such as the [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.engr.wisc.edu/isye.html).

It's important to think about how a Ph.D. fits in with other life decisions. I definitely felt like it would be hard to go back to graduate school if I started another career. And if I did go back, I was afraid that a two-body problem would mean that it would be easiest to go to the local Ph.D. program rather than move to go to a top Ph.D. program. Relationships need a lot of compromise and mutual sacrifice to work, and a Ph.D. doesn't always fit in nicely. I decided to go straight into graduate school so that life didn't get in the way later on. That's not the right decision for everyone, but it might be harder to go back than you may think.

Many people go and get Ph.D.'s later in their career as part-time students if their employers pay for them. This is a nice perk, and it is rare. This experience will be very different from that of the 22-year old student jumping straight into a Ph.D. program. The part-time career student may just be interested in getting a Ph.D. to qualify for moving up the corporate ladder. The full-time student should be more interested in building a set of skills and expertise to challenge important problems in their field for life. I believe that the motivation to get a Ph.D. should be more than just getting the diploma.

And it's worth saying that five years of guaranteed funding is a sweet deal. Think about it.

_Our hypothetical student specifically aspires to be an academic and sees a Ph.D. as essential to getting there. Do you any words of encouragement or caution about that goal?_

__Laura:__ It's a great career, but it's not for everyone. Graduate students should have plenty of time to discover if academia is right for them. I am introverted and was painfully shy at age 22. I did not enter graduate school with the goal of becoming an academic. Luckily, I was converted along the way.

_Do you have any thoughts on going from undergrad into a Ph.D. program verses first enrolling in a masters program?_

__Laura:__ There are many more funding opportunities for Ph.D. students than for Masters programs. If you're on the fence, apply to Ph.D. programs.

Let me be clear: a Ph.D. is not a Masters degree plus a little more coursework and a small project. This is a sketch of what my colleague Jason Merrick uses to explain the concept of a Ph.D. to prospective Ph.D. students. The Ph.D. student first sees the "hill" of coursework, which seems like a lot of work. From where the Ph.D. student stands when he/she starts a Ph.D. program, the second, bigger "hill" of research is not visible. But it is there. "All but dissertation" (ABD) is not very close to finishing. If the idea of tackling that hill of research is daunting, maybe consider a Masters instead of a Ph.D.

_Admission and funding aside, what should a potential Ph.D. student look for in a graduate program?_

All graduate students should look for top programs that have friendly faculty who have [interesting blogs](http://punkrockor.wordpress.com/) and/or engage in [human pyramids](https://twitter.com/JeffLinderoth/status/360139708254265344/photo/1). There should also be several [nearby lakes](http://www.countyofdane.com/lwrd/landconservation/img/lakeimages/lakemendota1.jpg) for [kayaking](http://www.plastic-castle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMAG0058.jpg) on days off, [bike trails everywhere](http://www.madisonareampo.org/maps/DaneCountyMapforBicylclists.cfm "Dane County Map for Bicylclists"), the [best union you've ever seen](http://www.union.wisc.edu/images/madison%20photos/terrace%20chairs2.JPG), [beer aplenty](http://www.newglarusbrewing.com/ "New Glarus Brewing") (and better yet - the birthplace of [kegball](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kegball)), and a [mascot who is a lovable woodland creature](https://twitter.com/UWBuckyBadger).[^uwm]

I have a [slideshare presentation on applying to Ph.D. programs](http://www.slideshare.net/lamclay/so-youre-thinking-about-graduate-school-in-operations-research-math-or-engineering) that has more tips and advice.

_What should a Ph.D. student look for in an advisor?_

__Laura:__ Choosing an advisor is a two way street. One thing prospective students may not know is that no faculty member has to oversee their dissertation research. It's important to be polite, diligent, and responsible with faculty. Even in a big program, there may be only a couple of faculty members whose interests may match yours. You will not finish if one of them isn't on your side. [Chris Chambers put it well](http://neurochambers.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/tough-love-insensitive-guide-to.html "NeuroChambers: Tough love: An insensitive guide to thriving in your PhD"): "Above all, remember that you and your supervisor are in this together. Those three years can be an energizing, productive, and career-making partnership. But they can also be a frustrating waste of time and energy. If you want your supervisor to go above and beyond for you, then lead by example and work your butt off."
