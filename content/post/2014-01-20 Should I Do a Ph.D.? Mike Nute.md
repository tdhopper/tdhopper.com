__Update 12-08-2014:__ I decided to make a dedicated website to host the interviews. You can find it at [shouldigetaphd.com](http://shouldigetaphd.com/).

A day late, but never a dollar short, the next contributor to [my series](http://stiglerdiet.com/category/should-i-do-a-phd.html) on whether or not a college senior should consider getting a Ph.D. is [Mike Nute](https://twitter.com/michaelnute), a current Ph.D. student. Mike scoffed at my banal interview format and instead wrote an open letter to a hypothetical student.

Dear Young Student,

First, as far as whether you should do the Ph.D. program, you should think long and hard about it because there is a lot of upside and a lot of downside. Here are some things in particular to should think about:

1) Going to a Ph.D. program straight from undergrad and continuing essentially the same field of study is a lot like marrying your high school sweetheart. Certainly for some people that works out ok, but for many others in ends in a terrible divorce. In the case of the Ph.D. program, you should bear in mind that the academic world and the real world are two very different places, and that up until this point you have only seen the academic world, so you might very well enjoy the real world just as much. Bear in mind also that the professors and advisors you have dealt with up to this point tend to be people who have thrived in the academic world and their advice will come from that lens. So do your best to get at least some exposure to the variety of jobs out there where you could apply the discipline. You should especially do this if the reason that you think you'd like to get a Ph.D. is to enter academia afterward. Take a little Rumspringa from that life before you enter the order.

2) If you find yourself thinking about the Ph.D. program as a means to an end, like as a requirement for some job, then you should strongly consider whether there is an easier way. More specifically, if you don't think that getting the Ph.D. is going to be fun on its own, then there's a strong chance you'll be miserable and it will end badly. If you want to be a professor, then getting a Ph.D. is really the only way to go about it, but for virtually any other goal there is probably an alternative that doesn't require the same sacrifice.

3) The way you should be thinking about the program is like this: it's a chance to spend five years doing nothing but studying your favorite subject in great depth while keeping adequate health insurance and avoiding debt. You really won't have either the time or the money to do very much else, so you had better really love this subject. You remember that episode of the Simpsons where the devil's ironic punishment for Homer is to force feed him an endless stream of donuts, but gets frustrated because Homer never stops loving the donuts? Well you have to love your subject like Homer loves donuts, because that's going to be you. If you do love it though, you won't even notice being broke or studying all the time. 

4) In fact, you should come to grips right now with the fact that you may finish your Ph.D. and find that you want to change careers and never revisit that subject again. That may sound unimaginable, but it's possible mainly because you're 22 and who the hell knows what you'll want when you're 28. If that happens though, will you look back on having gotten a Ph.D. as a terrible decision and a waste of time? If so, then don't do it. If you think you'll be proud of it and will have enjoyed yourself no matter what, then it's actually a low risk move because that's basically the worst case scenario.

5) You should also note that there is a major difference between a Masters and Ph.D. program. First of all, the Ph.D. will be much more intense, even in the first two years, than a Masters. Since most Masters programs are not funded but Ph.D.s are, you can think of it as the difference between being an employee and being a customer. But on the other hand, most industry jobs are as happy to have you with a Masters as with a Ph.D., so you can easily use the extra years of work to pay off the loans from the Masters program. This reinforces the last point above: the only real reason to do a Ph.D. program is for love of the subject. 

In my case, I came back to grad school after seven years in industry. From my experience you can take two lessons: 1) try to avoid waiting seven years to go back if you can, and 2) if you do wait that long, just know that it's never too late. The longer you wait, the harder the sacrifice of time and money will be. But you gotta do what's going to make you happy, and there are a lot of ways to be happy with a job. You can literally enjoy being at work every day, you can do something that benefits others, you can do something very challenging, or you can do something that enables you to enjoy other parts of your life, like gives you schedule flexibility or a sufficiently high salary. There are others too. In my case, I had a very tiny bit of all of those but not enough of any one to really count, which is why it took me so long to leave. Grad school though is challenging, and it makes me proud as hell to tell people about because I know how hard it is. So think about which of those is the most important to you, and plan accordingly. 

So anyway, good luck young man or lady, and don't stress about it too hard; you can always change your mind later.

Regards,

Mike Nute
