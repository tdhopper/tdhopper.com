[Sketching as a Tool for Numerical Linear Algebra](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-dpwoodru/journal.pdf): A neat paper on sketching algorithms for linear algebra. No, not that kind of sketching. "One first compresses it to a much smaller matrix by multiplying it by a (usually) random matrix with certain properties.  Much of the expensive computation can then be performed on the smaller matrix, thereby accelerating the solution for the original problem."

[Maps and the Geospatial Revolution](https://www.coursera.org/course/maps): Coursera is teaching a class in the spring on how geospatical technology has changed our world.

[Geoprocessing with Python using Open Source GIS](http://www.gis.usu.edu/~chrisg/python/2009/): Speaking of geospatial technology, here are some slides and problems from a class on "Geoprocessing with Python".

[How to use the bash command line history](http://blog.pluralsight.com/how-to-use-bash-command-line-history): Bash's history can do more than I realized!

[A geometric interpretation of the covariance matrix](http://www.visiondummy.com/2014/04/geometric-interpretation-covariance-matrix/): Superb little post explaning covariance matrices with pictures and geometry.
