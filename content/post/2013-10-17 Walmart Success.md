Steve Sashihara, [The Optimization Edge](http://www.optimizationedge.com/):

> What makes Walmart unique is its command of logistics. It continually deconstructs its entire supply chain, from supplier to distribution centers to customers, and treats each link as a decision point, asking a battery of microquestions: Where and how much to buy and at what price? Where to route goods? How to resupply and reorder?
