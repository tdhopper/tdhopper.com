[How can I pretty-print JSON at the command line?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/352098/how-can-i-pretty-print-json/1920585#1920585): I needed to pretty print some JSON at the command line earlier today. The easiest way might be to pipe it through `python -m json.tool`.

[Integrating Alfred & Keyboard Maestro](http://blog.iansinnott.com/integrating-alfred-and-keyboard-maestro/): I love [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) for automating all kinds of things on my Mac, but I'm reaching a limit of keyboard shortcuts I can remember.
