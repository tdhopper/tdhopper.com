[Ggplot2 To Ggvis](http://jimhester.github.io/ggplot2ToGgvis/): I'm a huge fan of ggplot2 for data visualization in R. Here's a brief tutorial for ggplot2 users to learn ggvis for generating _interactive_ plots in R using the grammar of graphics.

[From zero to storm cluster for scikit-learn classification | Daniel Rodriguez](http://danielfrg.com/blog/2014/08/01/storm-sklearn/): This is a very cool, if brief, blog post on using [streamparse](https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse "Parsely/streamparse Âˇ GitHub"), my company's open source wrapper for [Apache Storm](https://storm.incubator.apache.org/ "Storm, distributed and fault-tolerant realtime computation"), and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ "scikit-learn: machine learning in Python &mdash; scikit-learn 0.15.1 documentation"), [my favorite machine learning library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kx19t8bNMU "An Introduction to Scikit-Learn - YouTube"), to do machine learning on data streams.

[Pythonic means idiomatic and tasteful](http://www.pixelmonkey.org/2010/11/03/pythonic-means-idiomatic-and-tasteful): My boss Andrew recently shared an old blogpost he wrote on what it means for code to be Pythonic; I think he's right on track.

[git workflow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-repos): In my ever continuing attempt to be able to run my entire life from [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/ "Alfred App - Productivity App for Mac OS X"), I recently installed this workflow that makes git repositories on my computer easily searchable.

[Alfred-Workflow](http://www.deanishe.net/alfred-workflow/index.html): Speaking of Alfred, here's a handy Python library that makes it easy to write your own (if you're a Python programmer).

[Squashing commits with rebase](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html): Turns out you can use git rebase to clean up your commits before you push them to a remote repository. This can be a great way to make the commits your team sees more meaningful; don't abuse it.
