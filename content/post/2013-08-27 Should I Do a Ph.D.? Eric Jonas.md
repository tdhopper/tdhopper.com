__Update 12-08-2014:__ I decided to make a dedicated website to host the interviews. You can find it at [shouldigetaphd.com](http://shouldigetaphd.com/).

For my third [interview on this question](http://stiglerdiet.com/tag/should-i-do-a-phd.html "Tag: should-i-do-a-phd"), I talked with (soon-to-be Dr.) Eric Jonas. Eric is a Ph.D. candidate in computational neurobiology and, because of a very unique Ph.D. experience, brings a unique perspective to this question.

If you have any feedback on this series, please share it with me. I'm compiling feedback for a wrapup post at the end.

_A 22-year old college student has been accepted to a Ph.D. program
in a technical field. He's academically talented, and he's always
enjoyed school and his subject matter. His acceptance is accompanied
with 5-years of guaranteed funding. He doesn't have any job offers but
suspects he could get a decent job as a software developer. He's not
sure what to do. What advice would you give him, or what questions
might you suggest he ask himself as he goes about making the decision?_

__Eric__: The first thing to recognize is just how different a PhD program is
from being an undergrad:

Time allocation and duration: In undergrad, your life moves in
term-sized chunks -- you almost never have projects stretch over
multiple terms. Something is expected of you every week. In a PhD, you
are often much more at the mercy of your own motivation.

_Learning_: In undergrad, the focus is on learning as much new
information as quickly as possible, and all of the information is
well-organized. As hard as it may be to believe sometimes, there has
been a real focus on pedagogy by your instructors, textbook authors,
and institution. Problem set problems give you an instant sense of
"getting it right", and often have well-defined answers. Graduate
school classes are often quite different -- they are much smaller and
often built on top of reading cutting-edge research, with ambiguity,
contradition, and even politics.

_School status_: Most of us went to the best undergraduate institution
we could get into. Undergraduate "school name" carries weight, and
people (however unfortunately) pay attention to rankings such as those
in US News & World Report. This is much much less the case in graduate
school. What really matters is the advisor you work with, then the
department, and only then the school. The smartest MIT undergraduates
I knew at MIT scattered into the wind, some going to schools I had
only barely heard of, to work with the best set theoreticians, or the
best logicians, or the best experimental biologists, in the world.

My best advice to an undergraduate curious about the "experience" of
graduate school is: work in a lab while you're an undergrad. Or even,
take a year off and work at a low wage as a tech in a lab. Watch how
the students work with their advisor. Observe what their lives are
like. Figure out what makes someone a happy and successful graduate
student.

But above all, to speak directly to your hypothetical, never ever go
to graduate school as a "backup" to getting an industry job. I have
never seen this work out well. In graduate school for CS, your stipend
will be $30k a year and you will work 80 hours a week. Your friends
working 80h/week in finance will be making literally 10x that. You say
"I don't care about money" but how will you feel when you can't afford
to fly home because your parents are sick?

_You left your Ph.D. program and then returned. Why did you decide to go back?_

__Eric__: I never intended to "leave" my PhD program, and was actually
(unfortunately) a student the entire time I did both startups. I
always intended to finish. My work at the first startup, Navia, was
much closer to my core PhD research than my role as CEO at the second
startup, Prior Knowledge. My thesis was roughly finished around 2010,
but various aspects of running a company prohibited me from finishing
the "last bits", writing up the results for publication, and
assembling the committee. I would not recommend this to many people -- it caused a lot of additional cognitive burden and stress! Things
worked out well for me, but I want to stress this was the result of
both luck and working with the most brilliant people I have ever met
-- not through my own doing!

We also had incredibly supportive investors (Peter Thiel's group, The
Founders Fund), who were committed to advancing the long-term state of
the art. Prior Knowledge's acquiring company, Salesforce, has also
been very supportive in letting me take a little time here and there
to finish my degree.

_You also started a company while working on your degree. What advice
would you give to a current Ph.D. student considering the same thing?_

__Eric__: It depends -- if you're just leaving your PhD to go start a company,
that can be fine. I've heard (probably apocryphal) stories of Stanford
CS PhD students viewing graduate school as a holding pattern until
they do a startup.

If your entrepreneurial ambitions are related to your research, FINISH FIRST. You will have more credibility with investors, and you will
most likely have to deal with your school's Technology Licensing
Office to resolve IP issues anyway. Patents and scientific
publications can interact in many ways, some of which are good and
some of which are bad. Talk to other successful graduate student
entrepreneurs from your school to figure out the hoops to jump
through. Feel free to e-mail me if you're in this boat, I'm happy to
talk.

Finally, if you're going to ignore the above advice, check to see if
your school has some sort of "all but degree" (ABD) status, which can
save your advisor and department a great deal of money by reducing
your tuition costs.

_What benefit(s) does having a Ph.D. bring to your work industry? Is
a Ph.D. necessary for that kind of work?_

__Eric__: Beyond the credentialing problem in science (people take you much more
seriously if you have a PhD), learning how to execute and direct
research is the most important part of a PhD. I plan on living at the
interface between science and engineering for the rest of my life, and
formal training in that process has been crucial to my success.

A lot of people think of a PhD as being like an undergraduate degree
in that you've "learned a lot of material". This is false. You've
learned a set of skills to _produce_ knowledge -- to iterate on the
scientific process and engage with the scientific community. That's
one of the reasons why people basically never have "two" PhDs: once
you've learned how to "do" the science, it's supposed to transfer
across disciplines.
