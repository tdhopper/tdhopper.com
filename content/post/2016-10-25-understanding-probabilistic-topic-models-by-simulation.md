description: Presentation on understanding probabilistic topic models by simulating the generative model.
---

I gave a talk last week at Research Triangle Analysts on understanding probabilistic topic models (specificly LDA) by using Python for simulation. Here's the description:

> Latent Dirichlet Allocation and related topic models are often presented in the form of complicated equations and confusing diagrams. Tim Hopper presents LDA as a generative model through probabilistic simulation in simple Python. Simulation will help data scientists to understand the model assumptions and limitations and more effectively use black box LDA implementations.

I gave a [shorter version of the talk at PyData NYC 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R66X_udxZQ).
