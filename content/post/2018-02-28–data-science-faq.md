[Three years ago](https://tdhopper.com/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/), I wrote a posted called "How I Became a Data Scientist Despite Being a Math Major". 


When I wrote the post, I thought I was explaining that that was about all I know about how someone can become a data scientist. I must not have been as clear as I thought, because the post has lead to a lot of email from people who hope to become data scientist but don't know the route to get there. Most of the time, I have felt bad because I simply don't know the answers to peoples questions. But because so many people seem to have these questions, I decided to aggregate my uncertainty here. I hope you find it helpful.


*Should I get a masters degree?*

My sense is that a masters degree in a technical field is valuable. It takes a fraction of the time a Ph.D. takes, yet you can learn a lot in 3 or 4 semesters of coursework, and the degree is viewed favoribly by employers.

I'm wary of people going into deep debt for a masters degree. If you can get a teaching or research position that waves your tuition, do it. Also consider going a good school on in-state tuition instead of a great school for $100,000. If you have publically subsized graduate education (as in many European countries), go for it!


*Should I get a masters degree in computer science? Will it help me become a data scientist?*

I think a masters degree in computer science will be likely to pay off in the long run. It may not help you get a job as a data scienst, but it would undoubtly help you in a data science job. 

I have half of a computer science masters, and I sometimes wish I had finished it.

*Should I get a masters degree in operations research? Will it help me become a data scientist?*

I'm ambivalent about operations research. As a discipline, operations research has been in an identity crisis. As curriculum, many operations research programs are full of content valuable for data scientists. As a signal to potential employers, operations research is relatively unknown and won't mean as much as a degree in "machine learning" or something.

*Did you feel that operations research was too theoretical and had that you had to hustle outside the classroom and build stat/ML skills separately?*

Operations research programs have wildly different curriculums. Mine didn't do a great job preparing me for real-world applications, but that might be better learned on the job anyway. My program allowed me to build statistics and ML expertise only because I had flexibilty in the courses I could select; I was able to take a handful of stats/ML related classes. Other programs might not offer that.

*Should I get a masters degree in statistics?*

If you have strong programming/software engineering skills (or have another means of building them), a statistics degree could be valuable; as with anything, I'm sure the quality of statistics masters degrees varies greatly, and it's worth trying to find a good one.

*Will a masters degree help me become/be a data scientist?*

I don't know, but it has helped me. As I said in [my earlier post](https://tdhopper.com/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/), I learned a lot about algorithms, probability models, math, and machine learning that has been invaluable. Grad school also gave me the time and inspiration to learn R and Python which have played important roles in my career.

*Can I become a data scientist with only an undergraduate degree?*

Many others have. I have known several who don't even have college degrees.

*I'm in school should I take X class?*

*Should I get a Ph.D.?*

[I don't think it's worth it for most people.](https://mobile.twitter.com/shouldyougetphd) [But I have a dedicated website to help you answer this question.](https://shouldigetaphd.com)

*Can you evaluate my qualifications for being a data scientist?*

Not very well. In fact, [I think it's pretty challenging](https://tdhopper.com/blog/some-reflections-on-being-turned-down-for-a-lot-of-data-science-jobs/) even for people who interview data science candidates. Beyond [the things I outline in my original post](https://tdhopper.com/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/) as being important for my own career, I'm 

*How do I show-on-my-resume/demonstrate-to-employers that I am qualified to be a data scientist?*

My best advice is to work on interesting and relevant things and [tell people about them](https://youtu.be/uRul8QdYvqQ). I don't know how to be more specific. 

*Can we find a time to talk on the phone about this?*

Unfortunately, I don't have the time and energy to do this.

*How can I get a job where I can do more applied math?*

Even in data science jobs, a lot of the work is far removed from interesting math. My hypothesis is that relatively few people get to spend a substantial part of their job thinking about interesting math. I've [almost](https://github.com/datamicroscopes/lda/graphs/contributors) never gotten to spend as much time doing math as [I would like](https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/684380622639333376).

*What skills would you recommend I develop?*

You can never be a good enough writer, communicator, software engineer, linear algebraist, or applied statistican. Tenacity is important too, though I'm not sure how you develop it.

*Am I doing the right things to build a successful career in data science?*

I honestly don't know. 

*I'm in a career as a teacher/developer/analyst/etc. Can you advise me on how I can transition be a data scientist?*

I have tried [to share the things that worked for me](https://tdhopper.com/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/); you might be able to emulate them, but I can't guarantee they'll work for you. I would encourage you to stay curious, keep learning, network (via the internet and face to face), and keep applying for jobs.S
