I have started to realize that [Monte Carlo methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) of various kinds keep coming up in my work. Despite significant application of Monte Carlo in my grad school research, I think I only know enough to be dangerous. I'd like to get a better grasp on Monte Carlo methods (especially MCMC and simulation).

I [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/359642533950787585) if anyone had a recommended reference that was readable and practical. Despite my love of measure theory, what I want is _Monte Carlo Methods for the [Very Applied Mathematician](http://www.johndcook.com/veryappliedmath.html)_, not a theoretical text.

I got several recommendations. I'm not sure that any are exactly what I'm looking for, but I am certainly going to look deeper into them. Interestingly, they are all Springer books.

Several people recommended Glasserman's [Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering](http://www.amazon.com/Financial-Engineering-Stochastic-Modelling-Probability/dp/0387004513). I don't work in the financial sector, so it's hard for me to evaluate the table of contents to tell how well it generalizes.

Someone else recommended both [Explorations in Monte Carlo Methods](http://www.amazon.com/dp/038787836X) and [Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo](http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Chapman-Handbooks-Statistical-Methods/dp/1420079417) for two levels of MCMC.

Finally, I got a recommendation for [Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R](http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Monte-Carlo-Methods-ebook/dp/B00440E0JO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1374616614&sr=1-1&keywords=introducing+monte+carlo+methods+with+R). This might be closest to what I'm looking for. It appears to cover a breadth of topics, and it includes lots of code.
