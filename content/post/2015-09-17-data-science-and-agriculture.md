I'm excited to see tools developed for the web being applied to offline domains like agriculture and health. I posed a question on Twitter yesterday:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who is hiring at the intersection data science and agriculture?</p>&mdash; Tim Hopper (@tdhopper) <a href="https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/644138076521021440">September 16, 2015</a></blockquote>
