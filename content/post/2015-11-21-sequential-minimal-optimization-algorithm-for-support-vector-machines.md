In my nonlinear optimization class in grad school at North Carolina State University, I wrote a paper on the famed SMO algorithm for support vector machines. In particular, I derive the Lagrangian dual of the classic formulation of the SVM optimization model and show how it can be solved using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

You can [find the paper here](https://github.com/tdhopper/smo-svm/blob/master/OR706%20Support%20Vector%20Machines.pdf).
