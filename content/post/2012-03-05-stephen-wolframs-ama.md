Stephen Wolfram, of Wolfram Research and Mathematica fame, did a [Q&A (i.e. AMA) on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/) today. I just enjoyed reading through his answers. A few interesting answers stood out to me.

Someone ask Wolfram's opinion on P=NP. [He thinks it's undecidable](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xy53q)[^1ama].

Some smart aleck [threw the Riemann hypothesis at him](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxmie). Interestingly, Wolfram also suspects this is undecidable[^2ama].

One questioner asked about open sourcing old versions of Mathematica. [Wolfram responded very winsomely](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xz8by), in my view. I didn't know that they've thought about making the core language more freely available. I'd like to see that.

His most interesting answer is [his opinion on Matlab](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxhvt). He argues that Matlab has remained matrix-centric when so much of contemporary mathematics goes beyond that. "In the complete web of algorithms in Mathematica, things that can reasonably be represented as numerical matrices are perhaps 5 or 10% of the total." However, Wolfram believes that Mathematica isn't outdone by Maple in the realm of matrices.

Wolfram relays that a major goal of Mathematica is "to make a single coherent system in which one can work, and in which everything fits nicely together." [I argued](http://www.tdhopper.com/blog/mathematica-a-love-story/) that that's one thing they've done quite well.

I appreciate Wolfram doing this. I continue to be optimistic about Mathematica as a product, and I hope they have a bright future ahead of them.

[^2ama]: Both the Riemann hypothesis and P=NP have been around for many years and have a big bounty on solving them: http://www.claymath.org/millennium/.
