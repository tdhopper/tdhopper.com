description: Daniel Kahneman on the optimistism and exaggeration required for scientific success.
---

> I have always believed that scientific research is another domain where a form of optimism is essential to success: I have yet to meet a successful scientist who lacks the ability to exaggerate the importance of what he or she is doing, and I believe that someone who lacks a delusional sense of significance will wilt in the face of repeated experiences of multiple small failures and rare successes, the fate of most researchers.

â€” Daniel Kahneman, [Thinking, Fast and Slow](Thinking Fast and Slow)
