description: Link to Fred Benenson recap on his 6 years of data science at Kickstarter.

[Fred Benenson](https://twitter.com/fredbenenson) spent 6 years doing data science at Kickstarter. When he left last year, he wrote a [fantastic recap](https://hackernoon.com/on-to-the-next-2-271-days-309d6ba672d7) of his experience.

His "list of things I've discovered over the years" is particularly good. Here are a few of the things that resonated with me:

<blockquote>
<li> The more you can work with someone to help refine their question the easier it will be to answer
<li> Conducting a randomized controlled experiment via an A/B test is always better than analyzing historical data
<li> Metrics are crucial to the story a company tells itself; it is essential to honestly and rigorously define them
<li> Good experimental design is difficult; don't allow a great testing framework to let you get lazy with it
<li> Data science (A/B testing, etc.) can help you how to optimize for a particular outcome, but it will never tell you which particular outcome to optimize for
<li> Always seek to record and attain data in its rawest form, whether you're instrumenting something yourself or retrieving it from an API
</blockquote>

I highly recommend reading [the whole post](https://hackernoon.com/on-to-the-next-2-271-days-309d6ba672d7).
