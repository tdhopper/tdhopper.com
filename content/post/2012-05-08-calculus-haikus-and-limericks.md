I offered my calculus students bonus points to write a limerick or haiku on their final exam. I got some great answers! And the students seem to enjoy it. My favorite limerick (on improper integrals):

> An integral has bounds from zero to one<br />
> You finish the problem and think you are done<br />
> Then your mind double checks<br />
> The equation is one over x<br >
> And the improper integral has a different sum

My favorite haiku gives the formula for integration by parts:

> Int of mu dv:<br />
> Equal to mu v minus<br />
> Int of v d mu

Here are some other good ones:

> Doing Integrals… <br />
> Oh How I shall miss thee, <br />
> Calc! Goodbye, It's been real?
>
> Calculus is hard <br />
> Derivative and limit <br />
> ¡Yo no se hombre!
>
> MacLaurin Series <br />
> is an infinite series <br />
> Centered at zero
>
> Calculus is great<br />
> I'm sure I'll use this in life<br />
> Or maybe I won't

> Studying 'til 5<br />
> And almost sleeping thru test<br />
> Was a real bad call

> Finding integrals<br />

> Underneath the curve

> Calc is fun to do<br />
> If you like to integrate<br />
> x from a to b

> Calculus two, sigh<br />
> Why must you torment me so?<br />
> I thought we were friends
>
> F of e to x<br />
> Derived is e to the x<br />
> Lone function like it

> I like calculus<br />
> The feeling is mutual<br />

> Use another test

> Does this series telescope?<br />
> For my sake, I truly hope<br />
> Comparisons are icky,<br />
> Integrals make me sickly,<br />
> Turns out the answer is nope. :-(

Here are a few from when I taught at UVA:

> An integral is<br />
> A derivative reversed<br />
> Don’t forget constants!

> Thanks to L’Hopital<br />
> We can use derivatives<br />
> to find a limit!
>
> Find the area,<br />
> Between the two stated curves,<br />
> Using integrals.

> Natural log of Zero,<br />
> does not exist, but<br />
> Ln of 1 doesn't
>
> Calculus is great<br />
> But only if taught by<br />
