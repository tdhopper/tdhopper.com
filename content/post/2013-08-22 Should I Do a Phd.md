Over the coming weeks, I am going to be publishing a series of interviews on the question "Should I do a Ph.D.?" These interviews are with a variety of people: Ph.D.'s and not, academics and not. It's a question I've wrestled with at great length, and I know many others have as well. I hope reading the interviews will some answer the question themselves and help others provide counsel to those asking themselves this question.

I want to qualify myself slightly. I am primarily orienting this towards those with technical backgrounds going into graduate programs in the United States. This has several implications. First, I'm assuming that the student asking this question will have his tuition waved and be provided with a humble stipend. Second, I'm assuming a typical degree programs starts with two years of classes and is followed by 2-4 years of research.

Finally, you should look to two other resources in your quest to answer this question. First, read [Vivek Haldar's excellent post on the very topic.](http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/25136762019/advice-to-prospective-grad-students). Read it carefully, go for a long walk while thinking over it, and then read it again.

Second, read Matt Might's blog. Start with [The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D.](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/ "The illustrated guide to a Ph.D."), follow with reading his entire [Graduate School](http://matt.might.net/articles/) section, and finish by reading all the rest of his posts.[^mattmight]

 [^mattmight]: When you have mastered [C++ templates: Creating a compile-time higher-order meta-programming language](http://matt.might.net/articles/c++-template-meta-programming-with-lambda-calculus/ "C++ template programming: Embedding the lambda-calculus to show Turing-completeness") let me know.
