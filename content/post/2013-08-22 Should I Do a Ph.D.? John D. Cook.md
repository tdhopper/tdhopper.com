__Update 12-08-2014:__ I decided to make a dedicated website to host the interviews. You can find it at [shouldigetaphd.com](http://shouldigetaphd.com/).

To start my [series of interviews](http://stiglerdiet.com/category/should-i-do-a-phd.html) on the question "Should I do a Ph.D.?", I asked John Cook several questions.

_A 22-year old college student has been accepted to a Ph.D. program in a technical field. He's academically talented, and he's always enjoyed school and his subject matter. His acceptance is accompanied with five years of guaranteed funding. He doesn't have any job offers, but he suspects he could get a decent job as a software developer. He's not sure what to do. What advice would you give him?_

__John__: There are basically two reasons to get a Ph.D.: personal satisfaction, and credentials for a job requiring a Ph.D. It's hard to say what the financial return is on a Ph.D. Some say it lowers your earning potential, but that's confounded by the fact that people with Ph.D.'s tend to seek high security rather than high compensation employment. Some say a Ph.D. increases your earning potential, but they often don't account for the work experience you could have gained by working during the time it takes to complete a degree.

_Would you recommend he take some time off prior to grad school, or should he jump right in?_

__John__: Whether to go straight into grad school would depend on personal circumstances. It could be good to take some time to evaluate whether you really want to go to grad school or whether you are just doing that just because it's a natural continuation of what you've been doing for the past 17 years. If you're sure you want to do grad school, it's probably best to keep going and not lose momentum.

_Do you have any thoughts on going from undergrad into a Ph.D. program verses first completing a masters?_

__John__: There's more difference between a Ph.D. and a masters degree than many people realize. A masters program is a fairly direct continuation of an undergraduate degree. It's more specialized and more advanced, but it's still mostly based on class work.

The goal of a Ph.D. program is to produce original research and prepare for a career as a researcher. You won't necessarily even become very knowledgeable of the area you get your degree in. But you will develop the discipline of working on a long-term project with little external guidance.

In the humanities, you're often required to complete a master's degree on the way to a Ph.D. That's not as common in the sciences. By going straight for a Ph.D., you might graduate a semester sooner. It's nice to grab a master's degree along the way so that you have something to show for yourself if you don't finish the Ph.D.. But I think most schools will give you a masters on your way out if you go straight for a Ph.D. but don't finish.

_If you could do it over again, would you make any changes to the way you went about getting a Ph.D.?_

__John__: If I were to do my Ph.D. over again, and if I wanted to be an academic, I'd learn more about how the academic game is played. When I was in grad school, I learned a lot of math, but I didn't learn much about how to succeed in an academic career. I knew nothing about grants, for example, or strategies for publishing papers. I also would be more selective of my research topic, picking something I was more deeply interested in.

_You've spent much of your career doing work different from your field of expertise. What would you say to a current Ph.D. student who is concerned that his field or research is too specialized?_

__John__: You've got to set your own agenda for your time in grad school. In addition to what is required to graduate, you may have additional things you want to learn while you have the opportunity: access to libraries, access to people to ask questions of, and most of all, free time. (When I was in college, a pastor once told a group of students that we had more free time now than we'd ever have again. Of course we all thought he was crazy, but he was right.) You ought to have a survey knowledge of your field, even if that's not required for graduation. You also need to have some idea how your field relates to the rest of the world, and your professors might not be the best people to learn this from. If a professor has never worked outside of academia, I'd be skeptical of anything he or she says about "the real world."
