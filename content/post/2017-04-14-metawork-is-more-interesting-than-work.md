[This Software Engineering Radio interview](http://www.se-radio.net/2017/04/se-radio-episode-287-success-skills-for-architects-with-neil-ford/) with Neal Ford on Success Skills for Architects is full of gems about building effective software.

He talks a lot about how coders love to solve problems, and that love can lead them to invent interesting, but unnecessary, problems to solve. This is true.

> Metawork is more interesting than work. It's so hard to get back to simplicity, because we love complicated little puzzles to solve, so we keep overengineering everything.

Anyone who's developing software would benefit from listening.
