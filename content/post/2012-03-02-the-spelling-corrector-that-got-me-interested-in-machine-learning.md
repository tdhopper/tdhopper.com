Although I was a computer science minor, I'd never heard of statistical machine learning until after college. Now I dabble in machine learning on the side. In the long run, I'm interested in studying the intersection of operations research and learning, i.e. intelligent optimization systems. Two years ago, I stumbled across Peter Norvig's essay [How to Write a Spelling Corrector](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html). Google is a notoriously good spelling corrector; just try googling "[spellign](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=spellign&pbx=1&oq=spellign&aq=f&aqi=g-s4&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=355l2969l0l3671l8l8l0l0l0l0l152l775l4.4l8l0&gs_l=hp.3..0i10l4.355l2969l0l3672l8l8l0l0l0l0l152l775l4j4l8l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=6274c5cd76393bc1&biw=1257&bih=802)." I find that Google knows what word I'm trying to spell even when an application's built-in spell check fail. Norvig explains how to use Bayes theorem to write a pretty-good spelling corrector in 21 lines of Python. In college, I had good grounding in probability and computing, but I don't recall having seen the two mixed so elegantly. I'm pleased to now know that Norvig was only scratching the surface! This week, I've been watching Sebastian Thurn's lectures on [Kalman Filters](http://www.udacity.com/)Â for AI. Probabilistic techniques for filtering noisy data can be used, for example, in a robot keeping track of objects moving around it.
