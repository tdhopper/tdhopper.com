I have largely moved from Textmate to Sublime Text 2 for text editing. Among other reasons, Sublime Text is cross platform, and I use Windows at work and a Mac at home. I have also started writing as much as I can in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

I intended to write a blog post about using Sublime Text as a tool for writing Markdown. However, the inimitable Federico Viticci, of [macstories.net](http://www.macstories.net/), has [already written that post](http://www.macstories.net/roundups/sublime-text-2-and-markdown-tips-tricks-and-links/), so I will simply refer you there.
