People mention [John Cook's blog](http://www.johndcook.com) a lot [in Github repos](https://github.com/search?q=johndcook.com&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

I scraped the Github search pages to try to figure out which of his pages are most mentioned. His post [Accurately computing running variance](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/standard_deviation) gets many more mentions than any other post. It provides C++ code for Knuth's algorithm for computing the mean, sample variance, and standard deviation for a stream of data.
