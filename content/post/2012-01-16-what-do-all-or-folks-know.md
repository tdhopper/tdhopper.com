My friend [John Cook](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/) asked me an interesting question recently:

> If you had a room full of people with a graduate degree in [operations research], what things would nearly everyone in the room know?

Operations research is notoriously hard to define. According to the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science, “In a nutshell, operations research (O.R.) is the discipline of applying advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions.” I suspect graduate programs spend most of their time teaching those “analytical methods,” i.e. mathematical and computational techniques for modeling and solving problems related to decisions. Examples include Received exception: [linear programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming), [nonlinear programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming), [integer programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming), [dynamic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), [stochastic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_programming), [stochastic models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_models), [queueing theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory), [game theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), and [simulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation). The [course requirements](http://www.or.ncsu.edu/academics/msc.php) for OR PhD students at my university provide an upper bound for this problem: the only courses everyone must take are linear programming, nonlinear programming, and stochastic modeling. Some topics are surprisingly optional; in particular: simulation, statistics, integer programming/combinatorial optimization. John suggests that statistics PhD programs are similar. Topics diverge rather quickly after first year courses. Are all graduate programs like this? Is this a necessary evil (or evil at all)?
