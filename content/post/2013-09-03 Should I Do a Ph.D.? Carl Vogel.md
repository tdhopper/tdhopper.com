__Update 12-08-2014:__ I decided to make a dedicated website to host the interviews. You can find it at [shouldigetaphd.com](http://shouldigetaphd.com/).

For my next interview, I talked to Carl Vogel, an economic consultant in New York.

_A 22-year old college student has been accepted to a Ph.D. program in a technical field. She's academically talented, and she's always enjoyed school and her subject matter. Her acceptance is accompanied with 5-years of guaranteed funding. She doesn't have any job offers but suspects she could get a decent job as a software developer. She's not sure what to do. What advice would you give her, or what questions might you suggest she ask himself as she goes about making the decision?_

__Carl:__ The world is full of miserable grad students. Stressed-out, depressed, uncertain about when or if they'll graduate and what will happen to them when they do. Far more people go into Ph.D. programs than should. There are a two main reasons for this, I think. One is that for kids who've only really ever gone to school, and have been successful at it, grad school seems like a natural next step, and a career in academia seems pretty great. The other is that bright, academically talented twenty-two year olds just don't know themselves very well; they tend to be overly-optimistic about their abilities and their prospects. They've never really known failure or crippling self-doubt, and just can't imagine it as a real possibility.

So I'd suggest the healthiest way to think of grad school is not as a default next step---as "undergrad 2.0"---but to realize that it's a tremendous commitment in terms of time and psychological endurance and lost income. She's going to be giving up a huge chunk of her prime years. And during this time, the positive feedback she's gotten from professors and peers is going to disappear. The cycle of challenges and accomplishments she's been used to is going to be replaced by an intangible but ever expanding nebula of expectations and her every victory will be fleeting, unacknowledged, and Pyrrhic.

The needle on the Ph.D. gauge should start at "No." If she isn't really aware of what jobs she could do in her field, and what those look like in terms of career progression, she should definitely do that research. Software development is fine, especially if it's in a context related to her intellectual interests, and there's a possibility of learning, growing, and doing a variety of interesting work. She shouldn't take a job that doesn't excite her intellectually, unless she's really strapped for the cash or has a pile of school debt. At this age, she's got the chance to take a little financial risk for the chance to learn and get new experiences. There are a ton of interesting problems to work on in industry. She should make a real effort to see if any of those excite her. School isn't the only place to learn and do research.

To move the needle on the Ph.D. gauge to "Yes," I'd propose a 3-part process. Let's call the parts the Reality Check, the Personality Test, and the Skills Checklist.


**The Reality Check:**


I think a lot of students go into the graduate school decision with some overly rosy misconceptions. Mostly because their experience and advice to date has all been from within their department and university and is rife with selection bias. So it's important to burst a few bubbles for our hypothetical student.

1. She's not going to be a professor. In almost every field, the odds are just strikingly against getting a full-time, tenure-track position.
2. Attrition rates are higher than she probably realizes. There's a non-trivial probability that she'll drop out or flunk out before she finishes.
3. Even if she does finish, it's not going to be in 4 or 5 years. Think seven.
4. Grad school is not an intellectual salon, where she's going to be discussing the big questions and probing into deep insights about nature and the universe and all. There's some of that, to be sure. But it's large part tribal initiation (with all the gratuitous nonsense that implies), and no small part straight-up hazing.

It's important to be pessimistic when making this decision. If she imagines some tough, but not-improbable realities, and finds herself flinching, then grad school is probably not the right decision for her right now. For many, the realization that a successful academic career is unlikely is enough to deter them; if they're going to end up in industry anyway, why not start there?

If this bums her out a little, but she's so devoted to her field that she can accept these, she can go ahead and tick the needle towards "Yes" a bit.


**The Personality Test:**

Successful grad students aren't like normal humans. The following questions should test whether she's got the necessary personality traits.

Can she give one or, preferably, more examples of times working on a research project when she was:

1. **Inquisitive**: new research questions (not necessarily original ones) came to her while studying; when learning about a tool or technique she thought of new contexts it might be applied to.
2. **Disciplined**: she had set daily/weekly routines for making progress on a project; she persisted in these routines even when she was bored or burnt-out on the project.
3. **Obsessive**: she couldn't stop thinking or talking about her work; she couldn't tear herself away from a project without checking every detail, or testing every possible permutation of her model or experiment.
4. **Delusional**: she was sure she was going to uncover something new and important with her research.


**The Skills Checklist:**

Not all of these skills are necessary for someone going into a Ph.D. program---indeed, part of the point of grad school is to obtain these skills. But the more she goes in with, the less pain she's going to feel. If she's answering no to most of these, she'll want to hold off on a Ph.D.

1. Is she comfortable with at least some analytical software used in her field? R, SAS, Stata, Matlab?
2. Is she comfortable with at least one programming language like Python, Perl, C/C++, Java, etc.? (R or Matlab count if she's done more than just import data and run built-in functions.)
3. Does she have an organized and efficient workflow system? See, e.g., Keiran Healy's [*Choosing Your Workflow Applications*](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf).
4. Is she comfortable with mathematical proofs at the level of a first- or second-semester real analysis course?
5. Is she comfortable reading through an upper-level undergraduate or lower-level graduate textbook in her field? Does she have experience doing self-study at this level---not for a class or required project, but for her own interest?
6. Can she read and follow some recent empirical literature in her field?
7. Is she a competent, conscientious writer? Does she understand how to write in a clear, concise style, using plain English? Does she understand how to structure an argument, and compose clear paragraphs and sentences? Has she consciously tried to improve her writing, either in a class or by reading writing/style guides?

If she's gone through these three tests and the needle has moved most of the way towards "Yes," then I have a whole other slew of advice for choosing a program (more importantly, avoiding bad programs). The most effective of which is to buy beers for some grad students in the department. After two rounds you'll probably know whether or not you want to be in that program.


_She's decided to do her Ph.D. Would you recommend she take some time off prior to grad school, or should she jump right in?_

__Carl:__ There's a balance to strike here. On the one hand, I find people with a little more experience and maturity, as well as stability in their personal lives cope better with the stresses of a Ph.D. program (and tend to finish faster). On the other hand, the older you get and the more responsibilities you accumulate, the harder it is to bear the costs in time and income required by a Ph.D.

But if she's 22 or 23, and all she's known is high school and undergrad, then yes, I'd definitely suggest doing something else a year or two before her Ph.D. See the Skills Checklist above. Try and find a job that will let her check off some of those boxes. There are lots of them out there. A normal job also confers a lot of meta-skills useful for grad school: working on teams, putting up with assholes, communicating effectively, dealing with hard deadlines, structuring her time and work-flow.

While she's doing that, take some night classes, work on side projects, keep a notebook of research questions she'd like to look into. Also save up some money and try to get into a stable, monogomous relationship with someone whom she can go to for emotional support during her Ph.D. Do some traveling if she can.


_Do you have any thoughts on going from undergrad into a Ph.D. program verses first completing a masters?_

__Carl:__ In most cases (at least in the U.S.) an M.A. isn't really a meaningful prelude to a PhD. It's a different track. Indeed, I've spoken to professors at programs who've told me they avoid M.A. students---especially their own---in their Ph.D. admissions.

I wouldn't unequivocally say you shouldn't get an M.A.---I have two of them---but I'm a little down on them. I think many departments treat their M.A. programs as cash cows, and the programs don't provide a good return-on-investment.

So, given that, don't pay for an M.A. I didn't, and wouldn't have, paid for either of mine. Get a full-time job, look for a program with a part-time curriculum, and and try to get your company to pay for most, or all, of your tuition. Alternatively, some of the better programs will provide financial support or merit scholarships.

Also, pick your courses with an eye toward Ph.D. admissions. Talk to program advisors for advice on this. This typically means spending your electives taking Ph.D.-level courses. Whenever a course has an M.A. and a Ph.D. version, take the latter.

_What benefit(s) does having a Ph.D. bring for someone working in industry?_

__Carl:__ It really depends on the industry. For some it opens doors, often a lot of them; for others it's absolutely necessary to progress past a certain point. In some cases, it can actually be a negative---you get pegged as an egghead and put in the back office. Avoid those places, even if you don't have a Ph.D.

For the most part it's an easy signal to recruiters, hiring managers, bosses, colleagues, and clients that you've got a certain set of skills (even if you don't really have those skills). Obviously, you may end up using a lot of what you learned in your Ph.D. to do your job, but in my limited experience, someone without a Ph.D., but with enough experience on the job and who is a motivated learner can do pretty much the same work as someone with a Ph.D. Again, depends on the industry.

If you're working in a technical or research-oriented place where there are a lot of Ph.D.s, not having one may nix a lot of options for you, and you may have to fight to prove you can do the same work.
