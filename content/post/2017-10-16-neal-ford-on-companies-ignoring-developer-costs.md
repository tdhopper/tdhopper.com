> The downside of this is you have to have two production stacks... which is kind of expensive, but it's dirt cheap compared to amount of money people spend on developers hacking away at things that are making them crazy. This is one of those things that drives me crazy about companies... We will gladly spend a million dollars in overtime in developers to sit and work on our antiquated infrastructure, but we won't spend a thousand dollars to buy a new machine to make them not have to do do that.
