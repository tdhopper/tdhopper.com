[brushfire](https://github.com/stripe/brushfire): Avi Bryant has been building a 'Brushfire is a framework for distributed supervised learning of decision tree ensemble models in Scala.' Fun stuff!

[What are the lesser known but useful data structures?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/500607/what-are-the-lesser-known-but-useful-data-structures): I always enjoy StackOverflow questions like this, __but it is not considered a good, on-topic question for this site__, of course.

[Free Programming Books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md): A huge, crowd-sourced list of free programming books by language and topic.

[PhD Dissertations-Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/research/phd-dissertations.html): Seven years of ML PhD dissertations from Carnegie Mellon University.
