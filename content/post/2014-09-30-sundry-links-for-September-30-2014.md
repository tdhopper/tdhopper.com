[Hammock](https://github.com/kadirpekel/hammock/blob/master/README.rst): A lightweight wrapper around the Python requests module to convert REST APIs into "dead simple programmatic APIs". It's a clever idea. I'll have to play around with it before I can come up with a firm opinion.

[pipsi](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi#readme): Pipsi wraps pip and virtualenv to allow you to install Python command line utilities without polluting your global environment.

[Writing a Command-Line Tool in Python](http://nvie.com/posts/writing-a-cli-in-python-in-under-60-seconds/): Speaking of Python command line utilities, here's a little post from Vincent Driessen on writing them.

[Iterables vs. Iterators vs. Generators](http://nvie.com/posts/iterators-vs-generators/): Vincent has been on a roll lately. He also wrote this "little pocket reference on iterables, iterators and generators" in Python.

[Design for Continuous Experimentation: Talk and Slides](http://mcfunley.com/design-for-continuous-experimentation): I didn't watch the lecture, but Dan McKinley's slides on web experimentation are excellent.

[Apache Spark: A Delight for Developers](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/03/apache-spark-a-delight-for-developers/): I've been playing with PySpark lately, and it really is fun.
