I'm starting to love single-page informational websites. For example:

* [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com): [Olivier Lacan](http://olivierlacan.com/ "Olivier Lacan")'s guide to writing a _CHANGELOG.md_ for open source projects.
* [strftime](http://strftime.org): [Will McCutchen](https://twitter.com/mccutchen "Will McCutchen (@mccutchen) | Twitter")'s little page of the easily forgettable date formatting codes for Python programmers.
* [PyFormat](http://pyformat.info): [Ulrich Petri](https://twitter.com/ulope "Ulrich Petri (@ulope) | Twitter") and [Horst Gutmann](https://github.com/zerok "zerok (Horst Gutmann) Âˇ GitHub")'s guide to new style (`.format()`) string formatting in Python.
* [Two Factor Auth](https://twofactorauth.org): "List of websites and whether or not they support 2FA."

My website [Should I Get a Phd?](http://shouldigetaphd.com) is in this same vein.

Publishing a site like this is very cheap with [static hosting on AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html). I would love to see more of them created!
