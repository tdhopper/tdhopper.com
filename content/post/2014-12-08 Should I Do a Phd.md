Last year, I published nine interviews with Internet friends about how an academically-minded, 22-year old college senior should work on a Ph.D. Many people have told me the interviews have been helpful for them or that they've emailed them to others.

I decided to make a dedicated website to host the interviews. You can find it at [shouldigetaphd.com](http://shouldigetaphd.com/).

I hope this continues to be a valuable resource. I'd encourage you to share this with anyone you know who is thinking through this question.
