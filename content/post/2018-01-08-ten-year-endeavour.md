Ten years ago today, [John Cook](https://www.johndcook.com) published his first blog post entitled [Moore’s law and software bloat](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/01/09/moores-law-and-software-bloat/), a brief observation on how "Software bloat has increased at roughly the same rate as Moore’s law".

Since then, he’s written over 2,700 posts (nearly 1 per day) on math, computing, software development, statistics, science, and more. His posts are rarely long, but they always give me something to think about. Over the last six years since I discovered his blog, John has encouraged me to

* [realize automating might help me more by saving _mental energy_ than by saving _time_](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/22/automate-to-save-mental-energy-not-time/)

John earned his Ph.D. in applied math at UT Austin in 1992 with a dissertation on partial differential equations entitled [Diffusion models with microstructure and secondary flux](http://catalog.lib.utexas.edu/search~S2?/acook/acook/1%2C109%2C119%2CB/frameset&FF=acook+john+douglas+++++1966&1%2C1%2C). In the years since, he has worked as a math professor at Vanderbilt, a software developer, a research statistician at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and, since 2013, an independent consultant in statistics, mathematics, and computing. His breadth of career experience reflect his breadth of interests that make his blog what it is.


Though John has (wisely) avoided labeling himself a data scientist[^veryapplied], his writings have shaped every aspect of my trajectory from being a operations research grad student to a practicing data scientist. John is an [expert in Bayesian statistics](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/bayesian-consulting/), yet has [taught me much humility](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/01/01/making-sense-of-a-probability-problem-in-the-wsj/) about the power of statistics. John is a[ expert programmer](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/stand_alone_code/), yet [points me back to the importance of soft skills](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/10/02/the-mistakes-of-others/) for the success of software projects. John [loves applications of mathematics](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2017/12/12/efficiency-is-not-associative-for-matrix-multiplication/), yet reminds me to step back and see the [intrinsic beauty of mathematics](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/01/04/new-prime-number-record-50th-mersenne-prime/).

He also brings a unique approach in his posts on [music](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/tag/music/) and has a neat collection of [interviews](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/tag/interview/) he's done with [Fred Brooks](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/05/26/fred-brooks-interview/), [Michael Atiyah](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/09/24/interview-with-sir-michael-atiyah/) and others.

John’s blog is not his only educational outreach. He maintains [17 (!) Twitter accounts](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/twitter_page/) where he teaches about technical topics in <s>140</s> 280 characters or less. I'm always learning little tidbits from [@UnixToolTip](https://twitter.com/UnixToolTip) and find my schooling refreshed by [@AlgebraFact](https://twitter.com/AlgebraFact) and [@AnalysisFact](https://twitter.com/AnalysisFact).

One of John’s areas of expertise is implementing numerical algorithms in code. On his website, he has a [handful of technical notes](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/notes/) on this that many people have found invaluable. Two years ago, I did [a quick survey](https://tdhopper.com/blog/2016/Jan/13/mentions-of-john-cook-on-github/) of John’s articles mentioned in Github repos. Hundreds of repos cited his [Accurately computing running variance](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/standard_deviation/) article. No doubt countless more have used his resources without citing him!
