Listening to Russ Roberts' <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/">Econtalk</a> podcast for the last 5 years has given me a whole new perspective on the world. Roberts has exposed me to a whole new way of economic thinking, refined my scientific skepticism, and introduced me to copious topics and scholars.

Here are episodes from over the years that I've particularly enjoyed.
