[Ron Chernow](https://amzn.to/2GfHNbu) on George Washington's struggle with mail:

> Washington devoted far more time to the onerous task of draft letters than leading men into battle. Running an embryonic government, he protested to Congress that he and his aides "are confined from morn till eve, hearing and answering the applications and letters of one and another," leaving him with "no hours for recreation." He groaned at the huge stacks of correspondence and felt besieged by supplicants for various favors. At times the enormous quantity of paperwork must have seemed more daunting than British arms.
