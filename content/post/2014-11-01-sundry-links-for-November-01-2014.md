[The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html): I guess the title says it all. By Joel Spolsky.

[Unix Shells - Hyperpolyglot](http://hyperpolyglot.org/unix-shells): Very cool comparison of basic command syntax in Bash, Fish, Ksh, Tcsh, and Zsh.

[Better Bash history](http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/better-bash-history/): I'm pretty stuck on Bash at the moment. Here's a way to get a better history in Bash. (Other shells often improve on Bash's history.)

[usaddress 0.1](http://usaddress.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): I always love seeing a Python library for something I've tried to do poorly on my own: "usaddress is a python library for parsing unstructured address strings into address components, using advanced NLP methods."

[more-itertools](https://pythonhosted.org/more-itertools/api.html): A great extension to the helpful [itertools](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html) module in Python. Some particularly helpful functions: `chunked`, `first`, `peekaboo`, and `take`. Unfortunately, it doesn't have Python 3 support at the moment.
