Zen of Git

Ugly is better than beautiful.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Complex is better than simple.
Complicated is better than complex.
Flat is better than nested.
Readability is meaningless.
Special cases are everything.
Errors should never be comprehensible.
In the face of ambiguity, copy and paste from Stack Overflow.
There should be no obvious way to do it.
Although there may be endless non obvious ways to do it.
If the documentation is hard to understand, it's a great idea.
If the documentation is easy to understand, it's probably for another tool.
```

(With apologies to [Tim Peters](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).)
