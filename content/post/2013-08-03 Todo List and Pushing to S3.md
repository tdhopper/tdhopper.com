Being the nerd that I am, I spent several hours today writing scripts to automatically add a [todo list](http://stiglerdiet.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/todo/) listing posts I hope to write and papers/books/articles I'd like to read. These are automatically scraped from [Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/ "OmniFocus for Mac - The Omni Group") using [ofexport](https://github.com/psidnell/ofexport "psidnell/ofexport Â· GitHub").

To assist my future self or anyone else who might be interested in such an undertaking, I put up [a Github gist ](https://gist.github.com/tdhopper/6148009) giving some of the details on making this happen.
