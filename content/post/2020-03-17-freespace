A while back, I created [freespace.tdhopper.com](https://freespace.tdhopper.com/), a simple page to remind me how to free up disk space on my computer. I go back to it frequently to remember `docker system prune --all` and other commands. 

If you have any commands or tools that would useful, drop me a note or open a [pull request](https://github.com/tdhopper/freespace.tdhopper.com).
