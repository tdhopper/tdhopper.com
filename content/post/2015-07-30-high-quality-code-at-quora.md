I love [this new post](http://engineering.quora.com/Moving-Fast-With-High-Code-Quality) on Quora's engineering blog. The post states "high code quality is the long-term boost to development speed" and goes on to explain how they go about accomplishing this.

I've inherited large code bases at each of my jobs out of grad school, and I've spent a lot of thinking about this question. At least on the surface, I love the solutions Quora has in place for ensuring quality code: thoughtful code review, careful testing, style guidelines, static checking, and intentional code cleanup.
