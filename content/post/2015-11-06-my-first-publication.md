When I worked at [RTI International](http://www.rti.org/ "RTI International"), I worked on an exploratory analysis of Twitter discussion of electronic cigarettes. A paper on our work was just published in the [Journal of Internet Medical Research](http://www.jmir.org/ "JMIR-Journal of Medical Internet Research"): [Using Twitter Data to Gain Insights into E-cigarette Marketing and Locations of Use: An Infoveillance Study](http://www.jmir.org/2015/11/e251/).[^Infoveillance]

> Marketing and use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other electronic nicotine delivery devices have increased exponentially in recent years fueled, in part, by marketing and word-of-mouth communications via social media platforms, such as Twitter. ... We identified approximately 1.7 million tweets about e-cigarettes between 2008 and 2013, with the majority of these tweets being advertising (93.43%, 1,559,508/1,669,123). Tweets about e-cigarettes increased more than tenfold between 2009 and 2010, suggesting a rapid increase in the popularity of e-cigarettes and marketing efforts. The Twitter handles tweeting most frequently about e-cigarettes were a mixture of e-cigarette brands, affiliate marketers, and resellers of e-cigarette products. Of the 471 e-cigarette tweets mentioning a specific place, most mentioned e-cigarette use in class (39.1%, 184/471) followed by home/room/bed (12.5%, 59/471), school (12.1%, 57/471), in public (8.7%, 41/471), the bathroom (5.7%, 27/471), and at work (4.5%, 21/471).

[^Infoveillance]: I have no idea what "Infoveillance" means.
