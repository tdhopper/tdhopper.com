I created [a dedicated Github repository](https://github.com/tdhopper/notes-on-dirichlet-processes) for the recent posts I've been doing on Dirichlet processes.

I also [added a note](https://github.com/tdhopper/notes-on-dirichlet-processes#a-note-on-the-term-dirichlet-process) responding to some of Dan Roy's helpful push-back on my understanding of the term Dirichlet process.
