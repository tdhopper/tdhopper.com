__Update 12-08-2014:__ I decided to make a dedicated website to host the interviews. You can find it at [shouldigetaphd.com](http://shouldigetaphd.com/).

Continuing my [series of interviews](http://stiglerdiet.com/category/should-i-do-a-phd.html) on whether or not a college senior in a technical field should consider a Ph.D., I interviewed Oscar Boykin, a data scientist at Twitter. Prior to joining Twitter, Oscar was a professor of computer engineering at the University of Florida.

_A 22-year old college student has been accepted to a Ph.D. program in a technical field. He's academically talented, and he's always enjoyed school and his subject matter. His acceptance is accompanied with 5-years of guaranteed funding. He doesn't have any job offers but suspects he could get a decent job as a software developer. He's not sure what to do. What advice would you give him, or what questions might you suggest he ask himself as he goes about making the decision?_

__Oscar__: The number one question: does he or she have a burning desire to do a PhD? If so, and funding is available without taking loans, then absolutely! Go for it! It is a wonderful experience to try to, at least in one small area, touch the absolute frontier of human knowledge. If you greatly enjoy the area of study, and you find it is the kind of thing you love thinking about day in and day out, if you imagine yourself as some kind of ascetic scholar of old, toiling to make the most minor advance simply for the joy the work, then by all means.

The second reason to do a Ph.D., and this one hardly needs discussing, is that you want a career that requires it. If you want to teach at a university or do certain scientific occupations, a Ph.D may be required.

If the student has doubts about any of the above, I recommend a master's degree and an industry job. There are a few reasons: 1) If you lack the passion, the risk of not completing and the time investment do not equal the cost. 2) There is little, if any, direct financial benefit to having a Ph.D. and the cost in time is substantial. 3) Professions are changing very fast now and you should expect a lifetime of learning in any case, so without a strong desire for a PhD, why not do that learning in the environment where it is most relevant?


_He decides he wants to do the Ph.D. but his timing is negotiable. Would you recommend he jump straight in or take some time off?_

__Oscar__: Doing an internship or one year of work at a relevant company will often give students much better insight into choosing research topics. Choosing a great topic and a great advisor is the entire name of the game when it comes to the Ph.D. BUT, taking time off makes it very easy to get out of the habit of studying and learning, so if commitment is a concern, there is substantial risk that time off will turn into never coming back.


_Are there skills developed while earning a Ph.D. that are particularly valuable to being a practicing software engineer? Are there ways in which a non-Ph.D. can work to build similar skills?_

__Oscar:__ You can't take too much math. Learning linear algebra, probability theory, information theory, Markov chains, differential equations, and how to do proofs, have all been very valuable to me, and very few, if any, of my colleagues without PhDs have these skills. I have seen on the order of 3-10 people in the hundreds to ~thousand that I've interacted with, that picked these up on their own, so doing so is clearly possible. It is hard to say if getting a PhD helps learn those things: perhaps the same people who learned them with a PhD would have done so without. A safe bet seems to be structured education to pick up such classical mathematics.


_In your experience, are there potential liabilities that come with getting a Ph.D.? Do doctoral students learn habits that have to be reversed for them to become successful in industry?_

__Oscar__: One problem with the industry/academia divide is that each has a caricatured picture of the other. Academics fear entering industry means becoming a "code monkey" and often disparage strong coding as a skill. I think this is to the detriment of academia as coding is perhaps as powerful a tool as mathematics. Yet, many academics muddle through coding so much that the assumption by teams hiring academics is they will have to unlearn a lot of bad habits if they join somewhere like Twitter, Facebook, Google, etcâ€¦ This assumption often means that hiring committees are a bit skeptical of an academic's ability to actually be productive. This skepticism must either be countered with strong coding in an interview or some existing coding project that gives evidence of skill.

You didn't really ask much about the career path of academia vs industry. I did want to address that a bit. First, those paths are much more similar than most people realize. As a professor, on average, your colleagues are brighter, and that is exciting. But academia today is very focused on fund raising, and that fund raising is involves a lot of politics and sales-personship. In the software industry today, one has a lot of perks: great salary, lots (even unlimited) vacation time, the freedom to focus on the things you enjoy the most (compare to being a professor and doing 3-4 different jobs concurrently). As a professor, you are running a startup that can never be profitable: you are always raising money and hiring. The caliber of the very best in industry is also just as high or higher than academia (though the mean may be lower). I much prefer my job at Twitter to my time in academia.

_Oscar Boykin is data scientst at Twitter. He earned a Ph.D. in Physics at UCLA. You can find his scholarly work on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_occt=any&as_sauthors=oscar+boykin&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C34).
