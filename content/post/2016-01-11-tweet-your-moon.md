I created [a Twitter account](https://twitter.com/current_moon) that tweets a moon emoji each evening[^evening] representing the current phase of the moon.

I've wanted to do this for a while, but Joel Grus' posts about [AWS Lambda](https://github.com/joelgrus/polyglot-twitter-bot) inspired me to make it happen.

[The code for this is on Github.](https://github.com/tdhopper/moon)

I also created a [Github project](https://github.com/tdhopper/tau) that provides a template for creating Lambda-powered Twitter bots in Python.


[^evening]: Evening in the eastern United States.
