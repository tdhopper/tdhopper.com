A few weeks ago, I setup Travis CI [so this Pelican-based blog will publish itself when I commit a new post to Github](http://stiglerdiet.com/blog/2015/Mar/27/auto-deploying-stigler-diet-with-travis-ci/).

At the time, I asked on Twitter if there were any good Git clients that would allow me to push new posts from my iPad; I didn't get any promising replies.

However, I just found out about an app called [Working Copy](http://workingcopyapp.com) "a powerful Git client for iOS 8 that clones, edits, commits, pushes, and more."

I just cloned my Stigler Diet repo on my iPad, and I'm composing this post from the Whole Foods cafe on my iPad. If you're reading this post, it's because I successfully published it from here!
