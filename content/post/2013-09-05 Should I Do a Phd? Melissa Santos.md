__Update 12-08-2014:__ I decided to make a dedicated website to host the interviews. You can find it at [shouldigetaphd.com](http://shouldigetaphd.com/).

In this interview, I talked with Melissa Santos who is a software engineer at Etsy.

_A 22-year old college student has been accepted to a Ph.D. program in a technical field. She's academically talented, and she's always enjoyed school and her subject matter. Her acceptance is accompanied with 5-years of guaranteed funding. She doesn't have any job offers but suspects she could get a decent job as a software developer. She's not sure what to do. What advice would you give her, or what questions might you suggest she ask herself as she goes about making the decision?_

__Melissa:__ Make sure to get an industry internship every summer to get a view of the real world. Have a plan to get a masters degree midway, and reassess the Ph.D. decision at that point.

Part of not being sure is not having firmed up other options - apply to some of those programming jobs! What do you learn in those interviews? How does that stipend look with a salary offer in hand?

The only reason you HAVE to do a Ph.D. is to become a professor. That is also the aim of the people training you in a Ph.D. program, which can make it hard to be realistic about your goals outside of academia - the entire structure around you will be telling you that everything else is lesser.

_Do you have any thoughts on going from undergrad into a Ph.D. program verses first completing a masters?_

__Melissa:__ I did a masters first, and I don't regret it - it's part of what has let me have such a wide variety of academic experience. My thought at the time was that it was helping me decide if I like grad school enough to go on, but it didn't help me appreciate how much different a Ph.D. program is for a masters. The jump from coursework to research was a sharp break, and you will want to talk to your potential adviser's other students to learn how much help you'll get in that transition.

_What benefit(s) does having a Ph.D. bring to your work industry? Is a Ph.D. necessary for that kind of work?_

__Melissa:__ I work in tech. The Ph.D. might make my resume stand out a bit, but it's not necessary. To some extent, the process of getting the Ph.D. helped me have the mindset of putting together methods and being creative in my approach to problems that I'm not sure I would have with just the masters degrees. Masters degrees gave me toolboxes but the Ph.D. enforced that the tools come from people like me, and I can be part of building them.
