## Python 2 reaches end of life at the end of 2019!

Python 2.7 will not be maintained after 2019. The Python 2.7 will no longer receive security updates or receive new features.

You can see a countdown clock at [pythonclock.org](https://pythonclock.org).

## Python 3 has great new features

Python 3 has great new features including

* [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
* [f-strings](https://cito.github.io/blog/f-strings/)
* better Unicode support
* Matrix multiplication

## Open-source maintainers are dropping Python 2 support for their libraries.

The [Pandas maintainers are dropping Python 2 support next year](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/04/pandas-will-drop-all-support-for-python-2-next-year/).
